## Step 1 - Review the creative
Review the included design mockups(home-page.png and contact-page.png) Use html, css, and a hint of jquery to create the website. (note the slider with coffee cups in it!)

## Step 2 - Set Up Your Website
There's an index.html, and an assets folder. Included are all the images you need. Also noticed the bootstrap library is installed to help you with creating the grid layout, navigation, and maybe a few other things! [Check out the docs here. ](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) 

## Step 3 - Build It!
Create your html markup and use css to style it to look like the attached .pngs
